# Global-Internet-Trends-Analysis-Internet-Usage-GDP-and-Connectivity-Insights
This project explores **global internet trends** by analyzing datasets on **internet usage, GDP, cellular subscriptions, and broadband penetration** across multiple countries and years. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, trends, and relationships using data visualization techniques.

## Datasets Used

1. **Global Internet Users** (Kaggle): Contains internet usage statistics by country, including:
   - Country Name, Country Code, Year
   - Cellular Subscription, Internet Users (%), Number of Internet Users, Broadband Subscription

2. **GDP of Countries** (World Bank, via Kaggle): Includes:
   - Country Name, Country Code, Year, and GDP values

## Methodology

1. **Data Merging & Cleaning**  
   - The datasets were merged using Python, aligning entries based on `Country Name`, `Country Code`, and `Year`.  
   - The final dataset contains **8,868 entries** with 8 key features.

2. **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
   - **Tool Used:** Tableau  
   - **Techniques:** Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, maps, and tables  
   - **Key Insights:** Internet penetration trends, GDP correlation, geographic distribution of internet users  

## Visualizations

1. **Top 10 Countries with the Highest Number of Internet Users** (Bar Chart)
2. **Population vs. Number of Internet Users** (Comparison Bar Chart)
3. **Geographic Distribution of Internet Users Over Time** (Map)
4. **Percentage of Internet Users by Country** (Map)
5. **Growth of Cellular Subscription and Broadband Over Time** (Line Chart)
6. **Trend of GDP and Number of Internet Users (Worldwide)** (Line Chart)
7. **Correlation Between GDP and Number of Internet Users** (Scatter Plot)
8. **Internet Users by Region** (Table)

### Dashboard & Story Creation
- An interactive **Tableau dashboard** was created to showcase trends dynamically.
- A **storyboard** was developed to narrate the findings effectively.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate machine learning for predictive analysis.
- Expand dataset coverage to include post-2020 trends.
- Develop an interactive web-based version for data exploration.
